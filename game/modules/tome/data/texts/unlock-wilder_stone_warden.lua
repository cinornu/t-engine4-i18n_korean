return _t"New Class: #LIGHT_GREEN#Stone Warden (Wilder)",
_t[[While most races of Eyal firmly believe that arcane and nature forces are opposites, Dwarves have found a way to bind them together and meld them into a power to be reckoned with.

You have mastered some arcane and wild talents at a crude level can now create new dwarf characters with the #LIGHT_GREEN#Stone Warden class#WHITE#.

Stone Wardens are Wilders, who are at home in the wilds and draw their power from their connection with nature and arcane
Class features:#YELLOW#
- Dual wield shields and bash your foes with arcane enhanced shield strikes
- Combine arcane and nature forces to split yourself into two powerful halves
- Use vines of stone to grab and assail your foes
- Turn into a huge earth elemental and summon volcanos
- Dwarf race exclusive class (Select it at birth for the option to even appear)#WHITE#

All Wilder classes use Equilibrium for their powers. It represents their connection to nature. 
The higher it gets the more off-balance they are with it. A high Equilibrium makes for a chance to fail to use a power and lose a turn.
Stone Wardens also use Mana.
